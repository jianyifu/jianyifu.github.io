关于英中关系的演讲

by Patricia Hewitt
帕特丽夏·休伊特

Thank you for that introduction, Ambassador I'm delighted to be here at Invest UK's ICT seminar in Shanghai today, and to be ```sharing a platform with``` Sir Robin Saxby (Chairman ARM), Sir David Brown (Chairman Motorola UK) and Sir Chris Gent (Chairman, Vodafone).

感谢您的引荐，使者阁下。我很高兴今天能够参加英国投资局在上海举办的信息与通讯技术会议，并与罗宾•萨克斯比先生（ARM总裁），大卫•布朗先生（摩托罗拉英国总裁）和克里斯•金特先生（沃达丰总裁）```同台```。

Chris and Robin both ```appeared``` in Time magazine's "World's Top 25 Digital Players"just a couple of weeks ago. I'm delighted they're here to ```promote British excellence in ICT```—they really do represent the best of British.

克里斯和罗宾都是几周前```荣登```时代杂志“世界25强数码玩家”榜单，我很高兴他们来到这里```为英国信息与通讯技术做贡献```---他们真正是英国顶尖人才的代表。

Today I want to ```talk about``` the huge opportunities for our countries to ```work closer together```. Our nations have great and proud histories Together, our creativity, our innovation and our courage have ```set the pace``` in world economic development for centuries China invented paper, printing and ```blast furnaces```<sup>高炉</sup> for smelting iron Britain invented the computer, television and the Internet.

今天我想```谈一下```我们两国之间```紧密合作```的巨大机遇。我们民族有伟大荣耀的历史，我们的创造，我们的发明和我们的勇气已经为几百年世界经济的发展```起到了领头作用```。中国发明了造纸，印刷和熔铁的```喷火高炉```，英国发明了计算机，电视和互联网。

And now we  ```are on the verge of ```<sup>**濒于…，即将…**</sup>a new revolution. Information and communication industries are transforming the way we live, work and do business. Britain and China, together, have a chance to once again set the pace for the world. ```Building on``` <sup>基于，依托于</sup>our strengths—the best of old and the best of new—and China's new openness and participation in the global economy.

现在我们站在改革的边缘，信息与通讯行业正改变着我们生活，工作和从事商业的方式。英国和中国的结合将会再次引领世界潮流。结合我们的力量---最好的传统和最好的现代---中国加入全球经济的新一轮开放。

China's recent economic transformation-domestically and internationally—has been outstanding. The number of British businesses, ```figures```<sup>出现</sup> ```out here ```<sup>(老远）到这里</sup>this week ```pays testament to``` this. Digby Jones, Sir John Egan, the Lord Mayor of London and Sir Harry Kroto—the Nobel prize winner for his work on nanotechnology一have all been here this week, as well as as Pascal Lamy.


中国最近的经济转变---国内的和国际的---是很有成效的。~~英国商业数据~~本周出席会议的英国企业的数量就```证实了```这一转变。伦敦市市长迪格比•琼斯，约翰•伊根先生，和因纳米技术贡献获得诺贝尔奖的哈里•克鲁托先生，还有帕斯卡尔•拉米先生本周都来过这里。

China's GDP grew by 7. 8% in the second quarter of 2002 alone. And since my last visit here to Shanghai a year and a half ago, I have personally seen the most extraordinary change. Perhaps most significant though is China's new openness to the rest of the world, particularly since her accession to the WTO.

中国GDP尽在2002年第二季度就增长了7.8%。自从一年半前来访上海之后，我亲眼见证了这不可思议的改变，可能最令人瞩目的是中国对世界的开放，尤其是加入WTO后的开放。

We are now  ```working together``` as partners in the WTO, ```taking forward``` <sup>推动，促进，落实</sup>the Doha Development Agenda. China's activity in the global economy ```presents``` the world ```with``` challenges and opportunities—particularly us in Britain.

我们现在在WTO```同心协力```，一起```促进```多哈发展议程。中国在全球经济的活动给世界既```带来```挑战又带来机遇---尤其是给我们英国。

Challenges because, on the one hand, some of our more ```labour intensive industries```, like textiles in my ```constituency```<sup> [kən'stɪtjʊənsɪ]</sup>, will have to become ever more productive if they are to compete with low cost Chinese producers. And we will increasingly ```find our future lies in ```more technical textile production. rather than cotton T-shirts.

说挑战是因为一方面我们的```劳动密集型产业```，如我所在```选区```的纺织产业，如果要遇低成本的中国产品竞争就必须增加生产力，我们```未来会着眼于```更有技术性的纺织产品，而不是棉质T恤。

But,on the other hand, this is where our skills lie—in high value added, high skilled, knowledge intensive operations. So we also have a huge opportunity to benefit—as China develops outwards, moves into new markets and embraces new technologies—to offer our unique skills and expertise, which are so ```in evidence``` here today.

但另一方面，这也正是我们的技能所在---高增加值，高技能，知识密集产业。因此我们也有巨大的机遇来创造利润---随着中国向外拓展，寻求新的市场，寻找新的技能---我们提供独有的技能和知识就很```明显```了。

We are the best place in Europe to do business. This is not just ```rhetoric```<sup>['retərɪk],花言巧语，夸夸其谈</sup>. The statistics prove it. We attract almost a quarter of all investment into the EU, ```twice as much``` from the US ```as``` our closest European competitor, and around 40% of all Japanese investment in Europe.

我们位处欧洲商业的最好地段。这不是在```自夸```，有数据可以证明。我们吸引了欧盟投资的近四分之一，是我们欧洲其他竞争者从美国拉拢投资的两倍，占日本投资欧洲的40%。

There are three main ```strengths``` Britain has to offer ```inward investors```;

英国对```内投资者```有一下三大```优势```：

First, macro-economic stability—the crucial foundation for business success. We have the lowest inflation and interest rates in 40 years. In 2001, we ```experienced the fastest growth``` in the ```G7```.

首先，宏观经济稳定---商业成功的重要基础。我们40年来通货膨胀和利率最低。2001年，我们是```西方7大工业国``` ```增长最快```的国家。

Second, our position in the EU—```providing an excellent gateway into Europe```. The EU already ```offers a customer base of almost 400 million```. After ```enlargement```<sup>扩大</sup>, this will be almost 500 million.

第二，我们在欧盟的位置---```为进入欧洲提供了便利```。欧盟已经```提供了近4亿的客户群```，```进一步发展```后，这一数字将会接近5亿。

Third, British scientists, innovators, managers and leaders are the best in the world. With 1 % of the world's population, we fund 5% of the world's science produce 8% of all the world's scientific papers, and get 9% of scientific ```citations```<sup>[saɪ'teɪʃ(ə)n] 嘉奖</sup>.

第三，英国科学家，发明家，管理者和领导是世界最好的。虽只有世界1%的人口，我们却有世界科技5%的基金，产生世界8%的科研成果，并拿到9%的科学奖。

Our skills in research, software, marketing and design are the best in the world. And we are well ahead in areas like ```mobile communications``` and digital TV and in areas like ```semiconductor``` design. All areas are strongly represented here today.

我们在研究，软件，市场和设计方面的能力是世界最好的，我们在```移动通讯```，数码电视和```半导体```设计方面也处于领先地位。所有方面如今都卓有成效。

And it is these skills which I know are particularly relevant to you—because these are the skills that are ```driving``` the new information and communication technology industries. And Britain really is ```excelling in```<sup>擅长</sup> them, which is why world leaders such as Intel, CISCO and Exodux have all invested in Britain- Bill Gates has called the UK "the best place in the world to do E-business".

我们拥有的这些能力正与你们相关---因为这些是```推动```新信息和通讯技术行业```发展```的技能，英国在这一方面出类拔萃，这就是为什么像因特尔，CISCO和Exodux这些企业的领导都会再英国投资的原因。比尔•盖茨将英国称为“世界上做电子商务的最好位置”。

Ralph Averbuch, UK producer of Yahoo, has called the UK "… by far the most  mature on-line market in Europe". We have the most developed and largest market in ICT in Europe—one of the most connected economies in the world. We transact more than £ 57 billion worth of sales over the Internet. This is ```on a par``` <sup>等同于</sup>with the USA and Canada—and ```way ahead of ```<sup>**远远领先于**</sup>countries like Germany and Sweden.

雅虎英国生产商拉尔夫•阿费尔布赫称英国为“迄今为止欧洲最成熟的在线市场”。我们有欧洲最发达最大的信息与通讯市场---世界上最紧密的经济体之翼。我们网络交易额超过570亿英镑，与美国和加拿大```不相上下```---远远超过德国，瑞士等。

We are English speaking—the language of the Internet; we have high level management skills, a good business infrastructure, flexible labour market, stable politics  and excellent tax regime. And so this is why I say to you. If you are looking to invest in Europe, particularly in ICT, invest in Britain. Our two countries—with our great histories and our tremendous strengths—are natural partners.

我们以英语作为网络语言，我们有高水平的管理技能，良好的商业设施，灵活的劳动市场，稳定的政策和良好的税收制度。这就是为什么我对你们说，如果你们在欧洲寻找投资，尤其是信息与通讯方面的投资，就投资英国吧。我们两国有悠久的历史和巨大的能量，能做最好的搭档。

Many Chinese businesses are now making significant early investments into Britain. There are around 120 companies ```from mainland China``` investing in Britain——up from just fifty-three years ago Legend has positioned their European Marketing HQ in Slough. And Xinao has opened their ```European Liaison and Purchasing office``` in the North East.

很多中国企业正开始积极投资英国。现有约120家中国内陆企业投资英国---这仅仅是53年前才开始的。传奇已将其欧洲市场总部定位于斯劳，新奥集团已在东北部建立了```欧洲联络采购办公室```。

ZTE Corporation—China's largest listed telecoms manufacturer is now focusing on the European market. Their Chairman, Zhang Taifeng, described Britain as the "natural gateway into Europe".

中兴集团---中国最大的上市电信制造商现在也聚焦欧洲市场，中兴总裁张台风形容英国式“进入欧洲的天然大门”。

The Shanghai Foreign Investment Development Board has  ```opened an office ```in London—providing advice for Shanghai companies looking to invest in the UK. And I know Mr Liu Jinping, the Vice President, will be speaking to you later today.

上海外商投资发展局已经在伦敦```成立办公室```---为上海公司在英国投资提供建议。我知道副主席刘金平先生稍后会跟你们谈话。

So we've already ```got the fruits of ```a really strong relationship between us- And I hope that through all that Britain has to offer you—our economic stability; our position in Europe; and, in particular, our scientific excellence, creativity and innovation一allows us to build on this.

所以我们的合作已初见成果，我希望通过英国为你们头功的经济稳定，欧洲的有利位置，尤其是我们的科技成果，创造和创新能让我们立于此地。

China is key to our efforts. We now have six full time staff in China—from none just three years ago- Leading Edge has been the largest and most ```wide-ranging``` UK promotion we have carried out anywhere in the world this year.

中国式我们努力的重点。我们现在在中国有6名全职员工---三年前还一个人都没有。领先先锋是我们今年在世界各地举行推介会中最大且涵盖范围最广。

So we want to ```build up``` our relationship. And I look forward to working with all of you as we take the next steps forward together—the best of old, the best of new——in partnership, ```meeting the challenges of the global economy```.

所以我们```增进```两国的合作，我希望我们能携手共进---最好的传统，最好的现代---让我们一起```面对全球经济的挑战```。
